Object Detection with OpenCV and COCO Model
Project Logo/Icon

Overview
This project is an open-source implementation of object detection using OpenCV and the COCO (Common Objects in Context) model. Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within images or video frames. The COCO model, pre-trained on a vast dataset, can recognize a wide variety of objects, making it a powerful tool for numerous applications.

In this repository, we provide a simple yet effective implementation that allows you to perform object detection on images and video streams using the COCO model. You can also customize and integrate this solution into your projects for various applications, such as security systems, automated surveillance, and object recognition tasks.

Features
Utilizes the COCO model, which is trained to recognize over 80 common object categories.
Supports image-based object detection as well as real-time video stream analysis.
Provides easy-to-use Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for quick setup and experimentation.
Customizable for specific use cases, including object tracking and data logging.
Includes clear documentation and sample code to get you started.
